## Mom Jeans

Mom Jeans is a slim-thick digital Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) that blends pulsar synthesis with grain-width modulation. The module generates a train of regularly spaced harmonic grains while varying the width of these grains in a precise and pitch-related way. In hybridizing these two techniques, Mom Jeans opens up a surprisingly varied range of timbres, given a concise set of adjustable parameters.
